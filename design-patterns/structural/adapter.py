"""
Intent:

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
"""

"""
Solution:

Adapter is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate

1. The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects.
2. Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapterâ€™s methods.
3. Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects.
