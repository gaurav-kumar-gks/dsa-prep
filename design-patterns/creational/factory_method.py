"""
Intent:

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides 
an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
"""

"""
Solution:

The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) 
with calls to a special factory method. 
The objects are still created via the new operator, but itâ€™s being called from within the factory method. 
Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.


At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. 
However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and 
change the class of products being created by the method.
