Imp: don't use singleton
if a class has to be initialized only once -> create class in another package, and then import it

"""
Intent:

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance,
while providing a global access point to this instance
"""

"""
The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:
1. Ensure that a class has just a single instance
2. Provide a global access point to that instance
